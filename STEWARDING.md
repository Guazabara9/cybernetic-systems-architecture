# CSA Stewardship

Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA) is stewarded as a
disciplined, versioned intellectual canon.

## Stewardship principles
- Canonical releases are immutable once archived.
- Changes occur only through explicit version increments.
- Stewardship prioritizes clarity, integrity, and proportional evolution.

## Custodianship
Custodianship remains with the author and designated successors.
Stewardship does not imply institutional endorsement or obligation.

## Scope
Stewardship governs:
- canonical integrity
- version evolution
- archival continuity

It does not govern third-party interpretations or implementations.

Forks, mirrors, or derivative repositories do not constitute canonical authority unless explicitly designated by the rights holder.
