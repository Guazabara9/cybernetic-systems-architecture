# Security Policy (CSA)

This repository does not provide software, services, or operational systems.

If you believe you have identified:
- a material misrepresentation of CSA canonical materials, or
- a provenance, integrity, or attribution concern

Please contact the repository maintainer privately.

Do **not** open public issues for:
- theoretical risks
- misuse claims
- third-party implementations
- speculative concerns

Public issues may be closed without response.

This policy exists to protect canonical integrity and proportional response.
