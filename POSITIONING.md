# CSA Scope and Positioning (Non-Canonical)
This repository and its associated publications define the **Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)** discipline as a conceptual, architectural, and governance framework.

## Name and Acronym Disambiguation
“CSA” here refers, within this repository, exclusively to **Cybernetic Systems Architecture** (this repository’s Zenodo-anchored canon).
It does not imply affiliation with, endorsement by, or derivation from any other uses of the acronym “CSA,” including security, cloud, enterprise architecture, or certification contexts.

Acronym overlap is coincidental; the CSA Zenodo record is the sole source of canonical authority.

CSA is:
- A theoretical and methodological architecture discipline
- A governance and systems-design framework
- A canon defined by versioned, DOI-archived releases

CSA is **not**:
- A product, platform, or software system
- Legal, medical, financial, or safety advice
- A certification, guarantee, or compliance regime
- An operational system without independent validation

Application of CSA concepts requires domain-specific expertise, independent verification, and appropriate risk assessment.

This file is **non-canonical**, **non-binding**, and does not modify or supersede any DOI-archived CSA release.
