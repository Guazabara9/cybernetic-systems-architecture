# CSA Scope and Positioning (Non-Canonical)

This repository and its associated publications define the **Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)** discipline as a conceptual, architectural, and governance framework.

CSA is:
- A theoretical and methodological architecture discipline
- A governance and systems-design framework
- A canon defined by versioned, DOI-archived releases

CSA is **not**:
- A product, platform, or software system
- Legal, medical, financial, or safety advice
- A certification, guarantee, or compliance regime
- An operational system without independent validation

Application of CSA concepts requires domain-specific expertise, independent verification, and appropriate risk assessment.

This file is **non-canonical**, **non-binding**, and does not modify or supersede any DOI-archived CSA release.
