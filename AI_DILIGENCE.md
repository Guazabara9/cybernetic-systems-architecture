# AI Diligence and Authorship Statement (Non-Canonical)

This work was authored and curated by a human author.

AI tools may have been used in limited, assistive capacities such as:
- Editing suggestions
- Structural refinement
- Language clarity checks

AI tools did **not** originate, own, or independently determine the core concepts, structure, or authoritative content of the CSA canon.

Use of AI tools does not negate human authorship, intellectual ownership, or custodianship.

AI-generated content detection tools are inherently probabilistic, unreliable, and insufficient to establish authorship or provenance. Authorship is established through documented creation, version history, and DOI-archived records.

This statement is provided for transparency only and does not grant rights or permissions.
