# CSA Provenance Statement
This document describes the provenance and authority model for
Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA).

Forks, mirrors, or derivative repositories do not constitute canonical authority unless explicitly designated by the rights holder.

## Canonical authority
The authoritative CSA canon is defined exclusively by
DOI-archived releases on Zenodo.

Canonical CSA v1.0:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18058175

## Name and Acronym Disambiguation
“CSA” refers, within this repository, exclusively to **Cybernetic Systems Architecture**, as defined by the DOI-archived canonical releases on Zenodo and curated by the rights holder.

Role titles used in this repository (e.g., “Cybernetic Systems Architect”) are descriptive and derive their meaning solely from the defined CSA discipline. No exclusivity, certification, or ownership of titles is implied.

This usage is not affiliated with or endorsed by any other “CSA” organizations or frameworks. Acronym overlap is coincidental; canonical authority is established solely through the CSA Zenodo record.

## Repository role
This GitHub repository:
- mirrors canonical materials
- governs version control and integrity
- records non-canonical explanatory documents

GitHub history does not supersede DOI-archived records.

## Authorship and custody
CSA is authored and curated by a human rights holder.
Editorial tools, including AI-assisted tools, may be used
for refinement but do not constitute authorship.

## Temporal record
Authoritative timestamps are established by:
1. Zenodo DOI registration
2. GitHub tagged releases
3. Git commit history (supporting evidence only)

## Non-canonical materials
Files explicitly marked non-canonical do not modify,
extend, or supersede any DOI-archived CSA release.
