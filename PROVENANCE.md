# CSA Provenance Statement

This document describes the provenance and authority model for
Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA).

## Canonical authority
The authoritative CSA canon is defined exclusively by
DOI-archived releases on Zenodo.

Canonical CSA v1.0:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18058175

## Repository role
This GitHub repository:
- mirrors canonical materials
- governs version control and integrity
- records non-canonical explanatory documents

GitHub history does not supersede DOI-archived records.

## Authorship and custody
CSA is authored and curated by a human rights holder.
Editorial tools, including AI-assisted tools, may be used
for refinement but do not constitute authorship.

## Temporal record
Authoritative timestamps are established by:
1. Zenodo DOI registration
2. GitHub tagged releases
3. Git commit history (supporting evidence only)

## Non-canonical materials
Files explicitly marked non-canonical do not modify,
extend, or supersede any DOI-archived CSA release.
