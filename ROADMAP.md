# CSA Roadmap (Internal)

This document is **non-canonical** and **non-binding**.
It does not define standards, requirements, guarantees, or obligations.

Its purpose is to record internal intent and possible future directions
without affecting the CSA canon or its DOI-archived releases.

In the event of any conflict, **canonical CSA documents and DOI-archived
releases take absolute precedence over this roadmap**.

---

## v1.0.1 (Non-canonical)

- Clarifications and errata only  
- No scope expansion  
- No semantic changes to canonical definitions  

---

## v1.1 (Future, exploratory)

The following items are **provisional** and **subject to formal canonization
only through the CSA governance and versioning process**.

- Case study references  
- Applied implementation guidance
