# Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)

Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA) is a discipline concerned with the design, governance, and evolution of complex adaptive systems using cybernetic principles such as feedback, control, observability, robustness, and enforced constraints.

A Cybernetic Systems Architect is a practitioner of Cybernetic Systems Architecture who applies its frameworks, methods, and principles to real-world systems.

## Canon (v1.0)

The foundational CSA canon is archived as a DOI-registered scholarly record:

DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18058175

The Zenodo record is the authoritative canonical archive.
This repository governs canonical integrity, versioned evolution, and future releases under the CSA Versioning & Changelog Standard.

Only materials explicitly designated as canonical and archived via Zenodo DOI constitute the CSA canon. 

All other repository contents are non-canonical and may change without constituting a canonical revision.

## Repository structure
- `/canon/` — released canonical documents (mirrors of DOI-archived canon)
- `/methods/` — implementation techniques and templates (fast-changing)
- `/case-studies/` — applied work and examples (fast-changing)

## Stewardship
CSA evolves as a disciplined, versioned standard. Canonical changes are rare and deliberate; methods and applications may evolve rapidly.

Canonical changes require explicit version increments and archival publication.
See the CSA Versioning & Changelog Standard for governance of evolution.
