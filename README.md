# Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)

Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA) is a discipline concerned with the design, governance, and evolution of complex adaptive systems using cybernetic principles such as feedback, control, observability, robustness, and enforced constraints.

A Cybernetic Systems Architect is a practitioner of Cybernetic Systems Architecture who applies its frameworks, methods, and principles to real-world systems.

## Canon (v1.0)
The foundational CSA canon is published as a DOI-archived record:

- **DOI:** (to be added after Zenodo publication)

This repository mirrors the canon and provides a versioned evolution trail under the CSA Versioning & Changelog Standard.

## Repository structure
- `/canon/` — released canonical documents (slow-changing)
- `/methods/` — implementation techniques and templates (fast-changing)
- `/case-studies/` — applied work and examples (fast-changing)

## Stewardship
CSA evolves as a disciplined, versioned standard. Canonical changes are rare and deliberate; methods and applications may evolve rapidly. See the CSA Versioning & Changelog Standard for governance of evolution.
