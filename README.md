# Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)
**Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)** is a discipline concerned with the design, governance, and evolution of complex adaptive systems using cybernetic principles such as feedback, control, observability, robustness, and enforced constraints.

A **Cybernetic Systems Architect** is a practitioner of Cybernetic Systems Architecture who applies its frameworks, methods, and principles to real-world systems.

For common questions about scope, authority, licensing, and terminology, see **FAQ.md** (non-canonical).

### Name and Acronym Disambiguation
The acronym **“CSA”** in this repository refers exclusively within this repository to **Cybernetic Systems Architecture**, a discipline canon **defined and curated by Stephanie Luciano Perez** and established through versioned, DOI-archived releases on Zenodo.

This usage is **not affiliated with**, **derived from**, or **endorsed by** any other organizations, certifications, alliances, frameworks, or products that may use the acronym “CSA.”

Acronym overlap is coincidental; canonical authority is established solely through the CSA Zenodo record.

## Canonical Authority, Licensing, and Precedence
The Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA) discipline is governed by a strict hierarchy of authority and licensing:

### Canonical Authority
The authoritative CSA canon consists only of materials explicitly archived as DOI-registered releases on Zenodo.
These DOI records establish authorship, version immutability, citation authority, and canonical precedence.

### Licensing
Each canonical document specifies the copyright license governing that document’s text and distribution within the document itself and in its corresponding Zenodo record (e.g., CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 for CSA v1.0 canonical PDFs).

These licenses apply only to the documents as published works.  
They do not grant rights to the CSA name, acronym, discipline, or authority.

The repository-level license applies only to files that do not explicitly declare a license of their own.

### GitHub Repository License
The GitHub repository as a whole is all rights reserved, except where an individual file explicitly declares a license.
GitHub content serves as a mirror, integrity layer, and working surface, not a source of canonical authority.

### Conflict Resolution
In the event of any discrepancy or ambiguity, Zenodo DOI-archived records supersede all GitHub content.
This hierarchy exists to preserve canonical clarity, prevent misattribution, and ensure long-term scholarly integrity.

## Canon (v1.0)
The foundational CSA canon is archived as a DOI-registered scholarly record:

DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18058175

The Zenodo record is the authoritative canonical archive.
This repository governs canonical integrity, versioned evolution, and future releases under the CSA Versioning & Changelog Standard.

Only materials explicitly designated as canonical and archived via Zenodo DOI constitute the CSA canon. 
All other repository contents are non-canonical and may change without constituting a canonical revision.

## Repository structure
- `/canon/` — released canonical documents (mirrors of DOI-archived canon)
- `/methods/` — implementation techniques and templates (fast-changing)
- `/case-studies/` — applied work and examples (fast-changing)

## Stewardship
CSA evolves as a disciplined, versioned standard. Canonical changes are rare and deliberate; methods and applications may evolve rapidly.

Canonical changes require explicit version increments and archival publication.
See the CSA Versioning & Changelog Standard for governance of evolution.
