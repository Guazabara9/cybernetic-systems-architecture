# CSA FAQ (Non-Canonical)
This FAQ is **non-canonical** and **non-binding**. It exists to reduce misunderstandings, clarify scope, and direct readers to the canonical record.
If there is any conflict between this FAQ and the DOI-archived canonical releases on Zenodo, the Zenodo record governs.

---

## 1) What is CSA?
**Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)** is a discipline concerned with the design, governance, and evolution of complex adaptive systems using cybernetic principles such as feedback, control, observability, robustness, and enforced constraints.

CSA is a **canon**: a versioned body of work with an explicit authority model and provenance trail.

---

## 2) What is the canonical source of truth?
The **only canonical authority** for CSA is the set of versioned, DOI-archived releases on **Zenodo**.

GitHub is a **mirror and working surface** for:
- version control and integrity practices
- non-canonical supporting materials
- explanatory documents that do not modify the canon

Git history does not supersede DOI-archived records.

---

## 3) Is this a product, platform, or software system?
No.

CSA is not:
- a product, platform, or software system
- an operational system or service
- a compliance regime, certification authority, or credentialing body

CSA is a **conceptual and governance framework**. Any implementation is separate and must be evaluated independently.

---

## 4) Is CSA a certification, credential, or compliance program?
No.

CSA does not:
- offer certifications, credentials, licenses, or endorsements
- claim regulatory authority
- provide compliance guarantees

If third parties create training or credentialing around CSA, that is **third-party activity** and does not imply CSA endorsement.

---

## 5) Are you claiming ownership of the acronym “CSA”?
No.

In this repository, **“CSA” is used as shorthand for Cybernetic Systems Architecture**. Many other fields and organizations use “CSA” for unrelated meanings.

Acronym overlap is coincidental. This project does not claim exclusivity over the acronym.

---

## 6) Are you claiming ownership of the title “Cybernetic Systems Architect”?
No.

Role titles used in this repository (e.g., “Cybernetic Systems Architect”) are **descriptive** and derive their meaning solely from the CSA discipline as defined in the canon.
No exclusivity, certification, or ownership of role titles is implied.

You do not need permission from this project to use descriptive role language.

---

## 7) Is CSA affiliated with any “CSA” organization, alliance, certification, or framework?
No.

This usage is not affiliated with, derived from, sponsored by, or endorsed by any other organization or framework using “CSA,” including but not limited to security, cloud, enterprise architecture, or certification contexts.

---

## 8) Is CSA derived from or copied from prior cybernetics / systems / architecture literature?
CSA acknowledges intellectual lineage (e.g., cybernetics, systems theory, governance, architecture discourse), but it is not presented as a republication of any single prior framework.

CSA’s distinguishing claims are about:
- a **versioned canon** with explicit governance
- a defined **authority/provenance model**
- operational emphasis on **auditability, controllability, and enforced constraints** as design primitives

This does not negate prior art; it clarifies what CSA is (and is not) claiming.

---

## 9) What counts as plagiarism or fraud here?
CSA does not claim that ideas like “feedback,” “control,” “systems,” or “architecture” are new. Those are broad concepts with extensive prior use.

Plagiarism would involve copying protected expression without attribution where required. Fraud would involve misrepresenting authorship, endorsement, or authority.

This repository explicitly:
- separates canonical vs non-canonical content
- anchors canon to DOI-archived releases
- disclaims affiliation, certification, and endorsement
- discloses tooling use and rejects “AI detectors” as proof of authorship

These measures exist to reduce misinterpretation and prevent misattribution.

---

## 10) How do I cite CSA?
Cite the **canonical Zenodo DOI record** for the version you are referencing.

Do not cite GitHub URLs as canonical sources unless you are explicitly citing repository mechanics (e.g., commit history as supporting evidence).

---

## 11) Can I copy, redistribute, translate, or adapt CSA materials?
**Check the license stated in each canonical document and its corresponding Zenodo record.**

General rules:
- Canonical documents may specify a license permitting some forms of redistribution (often with restrictions).
- If a file does not explicitly declare a license, **all rights are reserved** by default.

Translations, adaptations, abridgements, or derivative works are only permitted if the applicable license allows them, or if you have explicit permission from the rights holder.

---

## 12) Can I use CSA commercially?
Only if the relevant document’s license allows it, or you have explicit permission.

Some canonical licenses may allow **verbatim redistribution** under restrictions (e.g., noncommercial, no-derivatives, attribution).
Commercial use and derivative use are governed by the license terms stated in the canonical record.

---

## 13) Can I fork or mirror this repository?
You can fork/mirror GitHub repositories as a platform function, but:

- Forks/mirrors are **not** canonical authority unless explicitly designated by the rights holder.
- Do not present a fork/mirror as “the CSA standard,” “official CSA,” or “canonical CSA” unless you are referencing the DOI-archived Zenodo record.

If you publish derivative repositories, you must avoid implying endorsement or canonical status.

---

## 14) Can I implement CSA in my own project?
Yes, but implementation is **your responsibility**.

CSA provides concepts and governance patterns. Real-world application requires domain expertise, verification, and appropriate risk assessment.

CSA does not provide legal, medical, financial, or safety advice.

---

## 15) Is CSA “open source”?
Not necessarily.

CSA is not automatically “open source” simply because materials are visible online.
Licensing is determined per document and per record.

Always follow the license stated in the canonical documents and Zenodo metadata.

---

## 16) Was AI used to create CSA? Does that change authorship?
Drafting and editorial tools (including AI-assisted tools) may be used for:
- language refinement
- structure and formatting
- consistency checks

Tool use does not transfer authorship, ownership, or responsibility away from the human rights holder.
No AI system is designated as co-author, originator, rights holder, or custodian of CSA materials.

“AI detectors” are not treated as authoritative evidence of authorship or infringement.

---

## 17) Why does CSA emphasize “canon,” “immutability,” and “governance”?
Because CSA is designed to be:
- *auditable* (what is claimed, and where)
- *versioned* (what changed, and when)
- *stable* (canonical releases are not silently edited)
- *traceable* (authority and provenance are explicit)

These properties reduce confusion and strengthen scholarly integrity.

---

## 18) Does CSA claim institutional endorsement?
No.

CSA does not imply endorsement by:
- universities
- employers
- governments
- standards bodies
- vendors or platforms

Any third-party mention of CSA does not create affiliation.

---

## 19) How should I report a concern (misrepresentation, attribution, provenance, or misuse)?
If you believe you have identified:
- material misrepresentation of CSA canonical materials
- a provenance/integrity concern
- an attribution concern
- a case of confusing “CSA” with another CSA entity

Follow the repository’s SECURITY policy / contact guidance. Where appropriate, report privately rather than through public issues.

---

## 20) Can I open issues or contribute?
If contribution mechanisms are enabled, they are typically intended for:
- typos
- broken links
- citation corrections
- clarity suggestions in non-canonical documents

Canonical documents are governed by the canon’s versioning and release process.
Public issues may be closed without response if they request canonical changes outside that process.

---

## 21) Is CSA legal advice? Can I rely on it?
No.

CSA materials are provided for scholarly and conceptual purposes only.
You must seek appropriate independent expertise for any real-world deployment, especially in high-stakes domains.

---

## 22) Quick glossary
- **Canon**: the authoritative CSA releases archived on Zenodo by DOI
- **Non-canonical**: explanatory or operational repository files that do not modify the canon
- **Provenance**: evidence trail establishing authority, authorship, and version lineage
- **Custodianship**: stewardship of the canon by the rights holder and designated successors
