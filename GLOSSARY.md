# CSA Glossary (Non-Canonical)
This glossary provides descriptive definitions for terms as used within the Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA) project.
It is non-canonical and does not override any DOI-archived CSA release.

### Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA)
A conceptual discipline concerned with the design, governance, and evolution of complex adaptive systems using cybernetic principles such as feedback, control, observability, robustness, and enforced constraints.

CSA is a framework and canon, not a product, software platform, or certification.

---

### CSA Canon
The authoritative body of CSA materials explicitly archived as versioned, DOI-registered releases on Zenodo.
Only these releases establish canonical definitions, precedence, and version history.

---

### Cybernetic Systems Architect
A descriptive role term for a practitioner who applies CSA concepts in analysis or design.
This term does not imply certification, licensure, exclusivity, or ownership, and may be used independently by others in unrelated contexts.

---

### Canonical
Materials that are explicitly designated as canonical and archived via Zenodo DOI records.
Canonical materials establish authoritative definitions and versioned precedence.

---

### Non-Canonical
Materials provided for explanation, illustration, discussion, or exploration.
Non-canonical materials do not modify, extend, or supersede any canonical CSA release.

---

### Governance Framework
A structured approach for defining authority, constraints, versioning, and evolution within a system or discipline.
CSA governance applies to the discipline itself, not to external organizations or implementations.

---

### DOI-Archived Release
A versioned scholarly record registered with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), used to establish authorship, immutability, and citation authority.

---

### Repository
This GitHub repository functions as a mirror, working surface, and explanatory layer.
It does not supersede or replace DOI-archived CSA records.
