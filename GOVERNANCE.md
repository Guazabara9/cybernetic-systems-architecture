# CSA Canon Governance

The Cybernetic Systems Architecture (CSA) canon is governed under the following principles:

- Canonical releases are immutable once published.
- All canonical artifacts are archived on Zenodo and referenced by DOI.
- This repository governs versioning, integrity, and future evolution.
- Changes to canonical documents require explicit version increments.
- GitHub repository state does not supersede DOI-archived canonical records in the event of conflict.
- Custodianship remains with the author and designated successors.
